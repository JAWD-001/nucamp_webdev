jQuery 

jQuery is a JS library that intended make DOM manipulation easier
also tried to bridge the gap between browser compatibility

syntax = always use $(document).ready which means that the DOM document object
is ready to load the following function when the browser loads
also use $() infront of elements and DOM related objects like events and elements to select them

Ex:
$(document).ready (function(){
	$(p).click(function(){
		$(this).hide();
	})
})

The drawback is that jQuery is imperative which means that you have to tell 
each element exactly what to do, creates a lot of dependcies, which can become 
tedious for large websites

imperative = a command, which means that commands can depend on commands, that can depend on commands

React solves this by being declarative, which means that it makes statements about the 
elements and objects in the DOM. This means that statements exist with relationship to each other
but not depending on each other
