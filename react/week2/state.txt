State = stateful variable

Stateful variable is a variable that are used to keep track of updates in an application

State is the current status of a stateful variable
-- think of this as an immutable object
-- object can be replaced by other state variables using state-setting functions

Global state is the state of the entire application
-- typically used for storing data that you want to share across an application
-- handled by a state management library like Redux
	# the global state variable is stored in the Redux store object
-- can also organize global state so that the global data for each feature corresponds
	to a "slice"

local state is the state of a specific component
-- best practice to keep state at the local state

state variables are always created as an object
-- local state 
	const state = {
		clicked: false,
	}
-- global state 
	const state = {
		currentUser: 'Sam',
	}

Use a special function called a React Hook function called useState() to manage React's local state
-- Will maintain global state with React Redux store 
-- Will use reducer functions to update global store if needed
