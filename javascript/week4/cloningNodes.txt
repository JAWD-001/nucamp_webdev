cloning nodes allows for you to make a new node based on another node

cloneNode() is the function to be able to clone a node that you have reference to. 
--Must have a reference to the exact reference that you want to node, typically will be stored in a variable

const newNode = nodeToClone.cloneNode();
-- this closed the node that you are cloning, not including children, siblings, etc. 
-- additionally, must still attach the node to the DOM
-- however, if you add true to, like so, cloneNode(true), it will clone all children nodes.

const newNode = nodeToClose.cloneNode(true) will clone the node and all children nodes as well.

--still not attached to the dom, must do that with .appendChild

//lastElementChild is the property version of the lastChild for elements only and skips text and whitespace nodes
