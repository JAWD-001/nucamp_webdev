Fetch API is used to request data from a web server
builds on the async/await syntax to fetch real world data

Fetch API allows you to make HTTP requests to servers from web browsers
which means you can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page 
refresh

A GET request is used to retrieve data from a server, Using Fetch, can make a GET with promises like such

fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
	.then(response => response.json())
	.then(data => console.log(data))
	.catch(error => console.error('There was an error'));
