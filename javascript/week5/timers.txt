timers allow us to delay the execution of some code for a specific 
amount of time

setTimeout()
includes two paraments (theFunctionNameBeingCalled, waitDuration)
functionBeingCalled, does not include the parenthesis as it is not being called 
waitDuration is in milliseconds

clearTimeout()
we can provide the numer timer id that is automatically generated by the 
setTimeout() function that is assigned to a variable

let ex = setTimeout(timer, 50);
clearTimeout(timerID);

setInterval()
this method repeats the given function instead of just running it once 
though it uses the given wait duration 
set up just like setTimeout(functionName, waitDuration)

clearInterval()
clearInterval is the same as clearTimeout, but for interval. 
Make sure to assign setInterval() to a variable in order to call the unique id
