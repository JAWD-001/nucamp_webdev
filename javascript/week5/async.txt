async programming allows time-consuming operations to run in the background
and provide results when ready, without bloxking other operations.
can be used through:
- promises 
- async/await

async is important because it allows us to write code that has:
- improved application performance
	+ Doesn't block other code from running
- enables concurency
	+ allows multiple operations to run simultaneously
- better user experience
	+ app remains responsive during long-running tasks
- more efficient resource utilization
	+ maximizes use of system resources by preventing them from being blocked
- simple code flow
	+ code avoids callback hell and complex code flaws
- scalability
	+ scale better by making optimal use of resources
