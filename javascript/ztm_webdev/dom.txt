What is the DOM?

DOM is eseentially the document that the browser creates to allow us to manipulate and/or modify the document with javascript

Javascript engine is an engine that reads javascript file line-by-line and executes in the browser

The window object contains a document object that has the html and css for the page.
The javascript engine for that browser then reads the JS file and allows the browswer to be ineracted with.

Can transverse the dom by declaring the document.body objects as node
node = document.body
This allows you to call certain objects as in 

node.firstChild = first child node of node
node.childNodes[1] = second child of the node element



DOM Selectors

let allP = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
//gets all p objects in the document//

let elementID = document.getElementByID("first");
//gets only the sinlge id element, remember IDs are unique//
	
let elementAllClass = docment.getElementsByClassName("second");
//gets all elements with the second class name
	
let elementQuery = document.querySelector('li')
//will select only the first item that it finds

let elementQueryAll = document.querySelectorAll('li,h1')
// will select all of the li items and also the h1 element



Adding attributes and classes to objects in the DOM

getAttribute
gets the attribute of the called node
so..

elementQueryAll.getAtribute('random')
returns the li element that contains the attribute named random

elementQuery.setAttribute('height","100px")
selects the first li element and adds height attribute of 100px to it
